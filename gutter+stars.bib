Protocol analysis is used to explore how code understanding might differ for small versus large scale code. The experiment confirms that cognition processes work at all levels of abstraction simultaneously as programmers build a mental model of the code. Cognition processes emerged at three levels of aggregation representing lower and higher level strategies of understanding. They show differences in what triggers them and how they achieve their goals. Results are useful for defining core competencies which maintenance engineers need for their work and for documentation and development standards}},

    abstract = {{Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these "data stories" differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into  their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.}},

Currently, answering these questions, such as "What have my co-workers been doing?", is tedious, and sometimes impossible, because the only support available requires the developer to manually link and traverse the information step-by-step. Through interviews with eleven professional developers, we identified 78 questions developers want to ask, but for which support is lacking. We introduce an information fragment model (and prototype tool) that automates the composition of different kinds of information and that allows developers to easily choose how to display the composed information. In a study, 18 professional developers used the prototype tool to answer eight of the 78 questions. All developers were able to easily use the prototype to successfully answer 94\% of questions in a mean time of 2.3 minutes per question.}},

To fill this gap we conducted two qualitative studies of programmers performing change tasks to medium to large sized programs. One study involved newcomers working on assigned change tasks to a medium-sized code base. The other study involved industrial programmers working on their own change tasks on code with which they had experience. The focus of our analysis has been on what information a programmer needs to know about a code base while performing a change task and also on howthey go about discovering that information. Based on this analysis we catalog and categorize 44 different kinds of questions asked by our participants. We also describe important context for how those questions were answered by our participants, including their use of tools.}},

We observed seventeen developers at a large software company and transcribed their activities in 90-minute sessions. We analyzed these logs for the information that developers sought, the sources that they used, and the situations that prevented information from being acquired. We identified twenty-one information types and cataloged the outcome and source when each type of information was sought. The most frequently sought information included awareness about artifacts and coworkers. The most often deferred searches included knowledge about design and program behavior, such as why code was written a particular way, what a program was supposed to do, and the cause of a program state. Developers often had to defer tasks because the only source of knowledge was unavailable coworkers.}},

	abstract = {Reducing the number of software failures is one of the most challenging problems of software production. Weassume that software development proceeds as a series of changes and model the probability that a change tosoftware will cause a failure. We use predictors based on the properties of a change itself. Such predictorsinclude size in lines of code added, deleted, and unmodified; diffusion of the change and its componentsubchanges, as reflected in the number of files, modules, and subsystems touched, or changed; severalmeasures of developer experience; and the type of change and its subchanges (fault fixes or newcode). The model is built on historic information and is used to predict the risk of new changes. In thispaper we apply the model to 5ESS software updates and find that change diffusion and developerexperience are essential to predicting failures. The predictive model is implemented as a Web-basedtool to allow timely prediction of change quality. The ability to predict the quality of change enables us tomake appropriate decisions regarding inspection, testing, and delivery. Historic information on softwarechanges is recorded in many commercial software projects, suggesting that our results can be easily and widelyapplied in practice.},

    abstract = {This book focuses on the human users of search engines and the tool they use
to interact with them: the search user interface. The truly worldwide reach of
the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and
laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design.
In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search
interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and
practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but
only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines.
This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of
search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in
commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines
and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is
specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry
professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as
graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information
systems.},

In previous work, we presented the G AMMA  technology, which facilitates remote analysis and measurement of deployed software and allows for gathering programexecution data from the field. When monitoring a high number of deployed instances of a software product, however, a large amount of data is collected. Such raw data are useless in the absence of a suitable data-mining and visualization technique that supports exploration and understanding of the data. In this paper, we present a new technique for collecting, storing, and visualizing program-execution data gathered from deployed instances of a software product. We also present a prototype toolset, G AMMATELLA , that implements the technique. We show how the visualization capabilities of G AMMATELLA  allows for effectively investigating several kinds of execution-related information in an interactive fashion.},

@inproceedings{Pauw08a,
    abstract = {Stream processing is becoming a new and important computing paradigm. Innovative streaming applications are being developed in areas ranging from scientific applications (e.g., environment monitoring), to business intelligence (e.g., fraud detection and trend analysis), to financial markets (e.g., algorithmic trading strategies). Developing, understanding, debugging, and optimizing streaming applications is non-trivial because of the adaptive and dynamic nature of these applications. The sheer complexity and the distributed character of a large number of cooperating components hosted on a distributed environment further complicate matters. In this paper we describe Streamsight, a new visualization tool built to examine, monitor, and help understand the dynamic behavior of streaming applications. Previously developed stream processing visualization tools focus solely on composition of dataflow graphs. Streamsight's novelty hinges on a wide range of capabilities, including the ability to manage the dynamics of large and evolving topologies comprising multiple streaming applications with thousands of nodes and interconnections. From rendering live performance counters using different perspectives to allowing recordings and replays of the execution process, Streamsight provides the mechanisms that permit a better understanding of the evolving and adaptive behavior of streaming applications. These capabilities are used for debugging purposes, for performance optimization, and management of resources, including capacity planning. More than 50 developers, both inside and outside IBM, have been using Streamsight.},

However, neither general-purpose search engines nor existing code search engines currently fit their needs, in large part because the information programmers need is distributed across many pages. We present Assieme, a Web search interface that effectively supports common programming search tasks by combining information from Web-accessible Java Archive (JAR) files, API documentation, and pages that include explanatory text and sample code. Assieme uses a novel approach to finding and resolving implicit references to Java packages, types, and members within sample code on the Web. In a study of programmers performing searches related to common programming tasks, we show that programmers obtain better solutions, using fewer queries, in the same amount of time spent using a general Web search interface.},

	    abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Large repositories of source code available over the Internet, or within large organizations, create new challenges and opportunities for data mining and statistical machine learning. Here we first develop Sourcerer, an infrastructure for the automated crawling, parsing, fingerprinting, and database storage of open source software on an Internet-scale. In one experiment, we gather 4,632 Java projects from SourceForge and Apache totaling over 38\&nbsp;million lines of code from 9,250 developers. Simple statistical analyses of the data first reveal robust power-law behavior for package, method call, and lexical containment distributions. We then develop and apply unsupervised, probabilistic, topic and author-topic (AT) models to automatically discover the topics embedded in the code and extract topic-word, document-topic, and AT distributions. In addition to serving as a convenient summary for program function and developer activities, these and other related distributions provide a statistical and information-theoretic basis for quantifying and analyzing source file similarity, developer similarity and competence, topic scattering, and document tangling, with direct applications to software engineering an software development staffing. Finally, by combining software textual content with structural information captured by our CodeRank approach, we are able to significantly improve software retrieval performance, increasing the area under the curve (AUC) retrieval metric to 0.92‚Äì roughly 10‚Äì30\% better than previous approaches based on text alone. A prototype of the system is available at: http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu.},

We are at the early stages of a research program that is aiming to answer three research questions: (1) How effectively can programmers express (using today's tools) the information they are seeking? (2) How effectively can programmers determine which of the matches returned from their searches are relevant to their task? and (3) In what ways can tools be improved to support programmers in more effectively expressing their information needs and exploring the results of searches? To begin answering these questions we have conducted a study in which we gathered both qualitative and quantitative data about programmers' search activities. Our analysis of this data is still incomplete, however this paper presents several of our initial observations about how programmers interact with the results from their searches.},

	    abstract = {We are now witnessing the rapid growth of decentralized source code management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository. DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators, rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

	    abstract = {The open source movement has made vast quantities of source code available online for free, providing an extremely large dataset for empirical study and potential resuse. A major difficulty in exploiting this potential fully is that the data are currently scattered between competing source code repositories, none of which are structured for empirical analysis and cross-project comparison. As a result, software researchers and developers are left to compile their own datasets, resulting in duplicated effort and limited results. To address this challenge, we built SourcererDB, an aggregated repository of statically analyzed and cross-linked open source Java projects. SourcererDB contains local snapshots of 2,852 Java projects taken from Sourceforge, Apache and Java.net. These projects are statically analyzed to extract rich structural information, which is then stored in a relational database. References to entities in the 16,058 external jars are resolved and grouped, allowing for cross-project usage information to be accessed easily. This paper describes: (a) the mechanism for resolving and grouping these cross-project references, (b) the structure of and the metamodel for the SourcererDB repository, and (d) end-user dataset access mechanisms. Our goal in building SourcererDB is to provide a rich dataset of source code to facilitate the sharing of extracted data and to encourage reuse and repeatability of experiments.},
